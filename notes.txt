Roman Numerals:
I (1)
V (5)
X (10)
L (50)
C (100)
D (500)
M (1000)

Arabic to Roman:
1??? -> 3???    : repeat (I or X or C or M)
4??             : concatenate ((I or X or C) + (V or L or D))
5?? -> 8??      : concatenate ((V or L or D) + repeat(I or X or C))
9??             : concatenate ((I or X or C) + (X or C or M))

Roman to Arabic:
- start accumulator
- read from left to right
- for each roman number, look at number on its right
  - if number on the right is less than or equal to current number => accumulator += current_number
  - if number on the right is greater than current number => subtract current number from number on the right (consume right)
  - if there is no number on the right, then we're done
- return accumulator
